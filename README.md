# Market Clearing Price Solver

## Project Overview

This is an implementation of a market clearing price solver and visualiser. The programme can take two csv files of the following format:

| Name | ID  | Quantity [MWh] | Price [â‚¬/MWh]  |
| ---- | --- | -------------- | ------------- |
| ...  | ... | ...            | .              |

for both supply and demand. They must be uploaded in a directory with a `name` and the csvs have the naming format `name_supply.csv` and `name_demand.csv`. The market clearing price will be solved, as well as ... .

The results will be stored as csv files in a directory `/solutions/name` and visualised (see examples in `/plots/name`). As is, the programme will run based on an example auction created Pierre Pinson for the [course](http://pierrepinson.com/index.php/teaching/) *31761 - Renewables in Energy Markets* at the Technical University of Denmark.
